# ShowCase Project: Logical Modelling Advanced


## Derived Properties
You can write functions which operate on existing properties of your model to create new ones.


## Class Inheritance
extend base classes to build more complex classes. In our example, AccountWithConstraints extends Account and adds more derived properties and constraints.


## Add Constraints to your data model
You can set up constraints to define conditions which the model must satisfy. In our example, constraints are added to the AccountWithConstraints class.

## Using StereoTypes
You can use stereotypes to categorize model elements. In our exmaple, we use temporal stereotype to mark the SynonymStereoTyped model as milestoned.
i.e it's queried as of a certain timestamp.

## Using Tags
Tagged values allow you to add more metadata to your model elements. In our example, we use doc tags to add some description in the model.
